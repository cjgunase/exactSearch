# exactSearch
This [web tool](http://sys.bio.mtu.edu/motif/) enables plant biologists to search for DNA motifs in the proximal promoters, and 3' untranslated regions of all genes from 50 genome-sequenced plant species. The motifs can be in the format of either degenerate sequences or Position Probability Matrix (PPM).
