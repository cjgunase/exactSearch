We have developed and efficient search algorithm to find a degenerate motif sequence in a target sequence.
Our [web application](http://sys.bio.mtu.edu/motif/) enables plant biologists to search for DNA motifs in the proximal promoters, and 3' untranslated regions of all genes from 50 genome-sequenced plant species. The motifs can be in the format of either degenerate sequences or Position Probability Matrix (PPM). 

This research was presented in a poster at 2016 Research symopsium of Life Science and Technology Institute.
